# Fin frontend (Vite + React)

This directory holds the Vite-powered React shell for the Fin workspace. The starter template already wires ESLint and Fast Refresh so you can focus on building UI.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Development

```
npm run dev
```

Runs the Vite dev server with HMR; open http://localhost:5173 and it will proxy to the backend (default: `http://localhost:3005`).

## Production build

```
npm run build
```

Outputs static assets to `dist/` which you can serve with `npm run preview` or drop into any host.
